# sql_queries

A repo for storing common/useful SQL queries.

# SQL Flavors
There are many flavors of SQL in use today: MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle SQL, and PostgreSQL, to name a few. Most SQL languages are based on a standard, with each having different subtelties.

Because we use the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/intro-whatis.html) flavor, this repo will likely only contain queries written for it. The queries may or may not be compatible with other flavors - something to keep in mind if you ever work at another company (God forbid) that uses MySQL, for example.

# PostgreSQL Documentation
In production we use PostgreSQL 10. The official documentation can be [found here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/index.html).

The docs can be difficult to interpret even for engineers, and so a "learn-as-you-go" methodology for SQL is recommmended. The documentation can be an invaluable reference, however, if one ever gets stuck on a tricky query or wants to learn more about a particular statement.

For example, the most commonly-used statement would be the `SELECT` statement. On the [documentation page for the `SELECT` statement](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sql-select.html), one can find a plethora of information about the different types of queries that can be built off of it.
